#  Movie Recommender System (Content-Based)

An end-to-end **AI-powered Movie Recommendation System** that suggests similar movies based on user selection using **Content-Based Filtering**.

---

##  Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build an intelligent recommendation engine that analyzes movie metadata and suggests **top similar movies** instantly.

Instead of relying on user ratings (collaborative filtering), this system focuses on **movie content** such as:

* Genres
* Cast
* Crew
* Keywords
* Overview

---

##  How It Works (Technical Overview)

### 1. Data Processing

* Combined datasets:

  * `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`
  * `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`
* Merged on `id`
* Selected important features:

  * Title, Overview, Genres, Keywords, Cast, Crew

---

### 2. Feature Engineering

* Extracted:

  *  **Director** from crew
  *  **Top 3 actors** from cast
* Cleaned text (removed spaces in names)
* Created a **"tags" column** by combining all features
* Applied **PorterStemmer** for normalization

---

### 3. Vectorization

* Used **CountVectorizer (Bag of Words)**
* Converted text into **5000-dimensional vectors**
* Removed English stop words

---

### 4. Similarity Calculation

* Used **Cosine Similarity**
* Measures similarity between movies based on vector distance

---

### 5. Web Application (Streamlit)

Interactive UI with:

*  Movie search
*  Pagination (500 movies/page)
*  Movie details:

  * Poster
  * Rating
  * Genres
  * Overview
*  Top 15 similar movie recommendations
